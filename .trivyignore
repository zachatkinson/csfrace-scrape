# Trivy ignore file - SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# 
# ⚠️  SECURITY POLICY: Only ignore CVEs after proper security review
# 
# Requirements for adding any CVE to this ignore list:
# 1. CVE must be verified from actual Trivy scan output (not guessed)
# 2. CVE must be unfixable at the application level (OS/base image only)  
# 3. CVE must not affect Python application or web service security
# 4. Include clear risk assessment and mitigation documentation
# 5. Set quarterly review dates for re-evaluation
# 
# ===================================================================
# CONSERVATIVE APPROACH: MINIMAL IGNORES ONLY
# 
# We maintain a security-first posture by ignoring only CVEs that are:
# - Confirmed from actual Trivy output from CI run 17226583565
# - In Debian base image components not used by our Python web service
# - Cannot be fixed through package updates in our application layer
#
# Review Date: 2025-08-26  
# Next Review: 2025-11-26 (quarterly security audit)
# ===================================================================

# APPROVED IGNORES (from verified Trivy scan results):

# CVE-2023-45853 - zlib vulnerability
# Justification: Marked as "will_not_fix" by Debian upstream
# Risk: LOW - Only affects ZIP file operations, not used in web scraping
# Library: zlib1g 1:1.2.13.dfsg-1
CVE-2023-45853

# NOTE: All other CVEs from the scan results are being addressed through:
# - Setuptools upgrade (CVE-2024-6345, CVE-2025-47273) 
# - Regular Debian base image updates for remaining OS-level CVEs
# - We do NOT ignore any CVE that could impact web application security
